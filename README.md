# NaaVRE development VM

A VM to run https://github.com/QCDIS/NaaVRE-dev-environment

## Overview

This repo contains configuration for a VM intended to run the [NaaVRE-dev-environment](https://github.com/QCDIS/NaaVRE-dev-environment). This allows developers to spend less time setting up a development environment on their own machines.

The VM runs:

- a minikube cluster (at 192.168.51.2)
- a container registry accessible from inside and outside the cluster (at 192.168.50.1:5005)
- a DNS that can resolve both public domain names and `.test` domains defined in ingress rules (at 192.168.50.1)
- a Wireguard VPN to access the above resources from any remote machine

When connected to the Wireguard VPN, traffic to 192.168.50.0/24, 192.168.51.0/24 as well as DNS requests go through the tunnel. Traffic to other local addresses and the rest of the internet is unaffected.

### Container registry internals

The container registry is deployed using [ctlptl](https://github.com/tilt-dev/ctlptl/), which also starts the minikube cluster and configures it to use the registry.

The registry is automatically discovered by Tilt ((read more)[https://docs.tilt.dev/choosing_clusters.html#discovering-the-registry]). However, the registry is using plain HTTP, and additional configuration is required in order to push images to it. There are two options:

- Build locally (untested). In that case, the local docker daemon needs to be configured to push to the insecure http registry at 192.168.50.1:5005. According to the [dockerd documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/dockerd/), this is done by adding `{"insecure-registries" : ["192.168.50.1:5005"]}` to `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.
- Build on the VM with buildx. To that end, create a new buildx builder instance using the [`buildkit.toml`](./buildkit.toml) configuration file:

  ```shell
  docker buildx create --driver kubernetes --use --config buildkit.toml
  ```

  then build and push images using:

  ```shell
  docker buildx build . -t 192.168.50.1:5005/my_image --push
  ```

## Creating the VM (for administrators)

**Step 1:** Create and configure a VM on OpenStack

Prerequisite: an OpenStack RC file containing credentials that allow you to create compute instances and network security groups ([doc](https://docs.openstack.org/newton/user-guide/common/cli-set-environment-variables-using-openstack-rc.html)).

This creates a new VM with Terraform and configures it with Ansible :

```shell
source /path/to/my-openrc.sh
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply --var ssh_pub_key=~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub --var instance_name=naavre-dev-vm-developersname-1
```

  **Step 1-a:** Create a VM

  - Recommended: 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 50 GB volume
  - Image: Ubuntu 24.04
  - Networking rules: allow incoming SSH and wireguard (22/tcp and 51820/udp)

  **Step 2-b:** Configure the VM with Ansible

  ```shell
  IP=...
  ansible-playbook -u ubuntu -i "$IP," playbooks/all.yaml
  ```

</details>

**Step 2:** Share the Wireguard and Kubeconfig files with the developer

The two configuration files are automatically downloaded by Ansible at `/tmp/naavre-dev-vm/IP/home/ubuntu/naavre-dev-vm/` (to find the IP, run `terraform show`). They should be sent to the developer as-is.


## Using the VM (for developers)

### Connect to the Wireguard VPN

First, install Wireguard ([documentation](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)).

You then have two options:
- Connect directly by running the command: `wg-quick up naavre-dev-vm.conf` (recommended where possible). To disconnect, run `wg-quick down naavre-dev-vm.conf`.
- Import `naavre-dev-vm.conf` in your wireguard client, or add the configuration manually.

Check the connection with the minikube cluster running on the VM:

```shell
$ ping 192.168.51.2
PING 192.168.51.2 (192.168.51.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.51.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=6.84 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.51.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=5.75 ms
...
```

### Configure access to the minikube cluster running on the VM

Install `kubectl` ([documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)). (*Note:* if you are using [NaaVRE-dev-environment](https://github.com/QCDIS/NaaVRE-dev-environment), `kubectl` is already installed in the conda environment.)

Check the connection with the kube API:

```shell
$ kubectl --kubeconfig naavre-dev-vm-kubeconfig get no
NAME            STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
naavre-dev-vm   Ready    control-plane   5m36s   v1.32.0
```

Once it works:
  - if you only need to access this kubernetes cluster: copy `naavre-dev-vm-kubeconfig` to `~/.kube/config`, and use `kubectl` without the `--kubeconfig` flag.
  - if you need to access multiple clusters, read how to [Configure Access to Multiple Clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/)

### Use the minikube cluster in Tilt

To deploy resources to the minikube cluster with Tilt, add the following line at the beginning of your `Tiltfile` (e.g. the `Tiltfile` at the root of [NaaVRE-dev-environment](https://github.com/QCDIS/NaaVRE-dev-environment):

```
allow_k8s_contexts('naavre-dev-vm')
```

In order to build docker images on the VM, run the following command in your terminal (read [Container registry internals](#container-registry-internals) above for more details):

```shell
docker buildx create --driver kubernetes --use --config buildkit.toml
```

You can then use the usual tilt commands. Resources will be deployed to the minikube cluster running on the VM.
